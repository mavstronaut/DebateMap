This document will contain random notes that have a chance of being useful sometime in the future.

* Newer versions of Webpack apparently need webpack-cli installed locally.
* If you update Webpack, remember to update both WebpackConfig.js *and* Vendors.webpack.js.
* If you have issues with some json files not loading in new Webpack, try adding the path to json-loader's "include" array.
